# Social-Media-Network-Manager-Graph-Theory-Project-
This project simulates how social media platforms analyse and visualise user relationships through graph theory. Each user is represented as a node, and each connection (friendship/follow) is represented as an edge. The application is built in Python using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

 Features
Connections Manager Class

Handles all network operations:

Add user

Add connection between two users

The graph visualisation is generated using a library such as networkx or matplotlib.

 Main Menu

A user-friendly console menu that:

Displays available options

Runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit

Allows interactive building of a social network

 Technologies Used

Python 3

NetworkX (graph structure + layout)

Matplotlib (visualisation)

 Output

A printed list of all users and connections

An automatically generated graph visualisation (network_graph.png)

Clean object-oriented structure for easy extension
