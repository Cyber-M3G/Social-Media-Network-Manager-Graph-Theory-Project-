# Social-Media-Network-Manager-Graph-Theory-Project-
This project simulates how social media platforms analyse and visualise user relationships through graph theory. Each user is represented as a node, and each connection (friendship/follow) is represented as an edge. The application is built in Python using Object-Oriented Programming principles.
